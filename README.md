In the DPZTN project, we have created the following three files:

1. **zerotrustnetworkelement**: This file contains the relevant utility functions required for the interaction between the zero-trust network element, users, and the blockchain.
2. **ztne.go** file in the **psbc** folder: This file contains the smart contracts deployed in the DPZTN.
3. **experimentation**: This folder includes experiments related to the ZTNE and user zero-trust processes, as well as methods for tuning the smart contracts.
